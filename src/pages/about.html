				<p>
					AvengeTech is an ever-growing family friendly Minecraft
					community. We focus on providing a safe and fun environment
					for players of all ages. Our community is committed to
					upholding values of respect, kindness, and inclusivity. We
					currently offer a variety of game modes and experiences,
					including the original Prison gamemode and a constantly
					updating SkyBlock experience!
				</p>
				<p>
					Founded by Sn3ak in October 2015, the network began with its
					first iteration, AT v1, featuring the Factions gamemode.
					This version lasted for nearly two years before Sn3ak
					decided to shut it down to rewrite and improve the server.
					In the summer of 2017, AT v2 was launched, introducing
					KitPvP and Prison gamemodes. These gamemodes brought new
					excitement and challenges to the community, but in late July
					2018, KitPvP was permanently retired. SkyBlock was
					introduced in early August 2018, replacing KitPvP and
					quickly becoming a fan favorite. The network continued to
					thrive with SkyBlock and Prison gamemodes until early
					February 2024, when it was shut down once again for a major
					overhaul. During the summer of 2023, Kally, Pringz, and
					Miguel joined the team, bringing fresh ideas and expertise
					to the design and development of the network. Their
					contributions were instrumental in shaping the next
					iteration of AvengeTech. AT v3 launched in June 2024,
					featuring a revamped version of the SkyBlock gamemode, with
					Kally and Miguel leading the development efforts. Prison was
					relaunched in August 2024, further solidifying the network's
					commitment to providing engaging and innovative gameplay
					experiences. With Kally and Miguel at the helm of
					development and Pringz managing the staff and community,
					AvengeTech has continued to grow and evolve, offering
					players a welcoming and dynamic environment to explore and
					enjoy.
